# stumpysnake
My COMP22111 (Processor Microarchitecture) coursework. We had to design a basic CPU using Verilog & Cadence with a minimal ARM-like instruction set called Stump (lol). The final task was to write a program for it and I made a little snake game which got full marks apart from for originality - someone else made snake as well :(
